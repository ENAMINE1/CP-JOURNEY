You place picked coins into a bag, but whenever the bag’s total sum becomes even, it is immediately emptied. Your final score is the sum remaining in the bag after all k actions. For each  𝑘 k, determine the maximum possible final score by choosing the order and selection of coins optimally.",No,Think a littel bit more it was easy
